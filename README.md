# FaceFillers-Electron

For my 2019-2020 Computing HNC, one task involved creating an application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), SQL Clauses, and a Relational SQL Database.

This project (currently) utilises:

- [NodeJS (^10.15.2)](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
  - [Electron (^8.0.3)](https://github.com/electron/electron)

## Building

Since this uses NodeJS, building requires utilisation of the Node Package Manager (NPM). Future plans involve integrating [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager) for building, but in the testing phase this command should be used instead:

```shell
npm start
```
